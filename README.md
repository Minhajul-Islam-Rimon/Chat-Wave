This is my project for CSE327 - Software Engineering.
In this project, I implemented a real-time chat application using the following technologies:

ðŸŸ¨ Node.js & Express.js â€“ for building the backend API

ðŸ”„ Socket.io â€“ to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between users

ðŸŽ¨ DaisyUI â€“ for fast and beautiful UI components, built on TailwindCSS
